The properties you need to add to each element are:

1. Make the element with both the avatar and proportioned classes 300 pixels wide, then give it a height so that it retains its original square proportions (don't hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).
2. Make the element with both the avatar and distorted classes 200 pixels wide, then make its height twice as big as its width (here you should hardcode in a pixel value).
